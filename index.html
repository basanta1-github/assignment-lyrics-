            So what we get drunk?
            <br>
            So what we smoke weed?
            <br>
            We're just having fun
            <br>
            We don't care who sees (Shit)
            <br>
            So what we go out? (Ayy, lemme get a lighter, please?)
            <br>
            That's how it's supposed to be ('Cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
            <br>
            Living young and wild and free (Keep that in there)

            <br>
            Ah, ah-ah 
            <br>
            So what I keep 'em rolled up?
            <br>
            Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
            <br>
            Keep it real with my niggas
            <br>
            Keep it player for these hoes
            <br>
            It look clean, don't it?
            <br>
            Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
            <br>
            Give me some 501 jeans on it
            <br>
            Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
            <br>
            And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
            <br>
            You a class clown and if I skip for the day
            <br>
            I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

            You know what?
            <br>
            It's like I'm seventeen again
            <br>
            Peach fuzz on my face
            <br>
            Lookin', on the case
            <br>
            Tryna find a hella taste
            <br>
            Oh my god, I'm on the chase, Chevy
            <br>
            It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
            <br>
            Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
            <br>
            Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
            <br>
            Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
            <br>
            Upfront, four blunts, like, "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

            <br>
            When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
            <br>
            That's how it should be done
            <br>
            Soon as you thinkin' you're down
            <br>
            Find how to turn things around
            <br>
            Now things are lookin' up
            <br>
            From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
            <br>
            So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
            <br>

            <br>
            Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
            <br>
            Got my own car, no job, no children
            <br>
            Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
